- Rename seedboxsync.conf.sample to seedboxsync.conf 
- Replace with your seedbox SFTP info where appropriate (username, password, port, password)
- On your seedbox, move the content you want downloaded to "downloads/completed"
- Seedboxsync will then automatically mirror that directory locally to /usr/share/seedboxsync
